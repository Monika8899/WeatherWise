1. One-Sentence Project Description : 
This project will fetch weather data from a free API, process it, and then give people personalized activity suggestions and alerts so they can plan their day better.

2. Chosen Programming Language & Reason : 
We decided on Python because itâ€™s easy to work with for both data handling (using pandas) and building a quick web app (using Streamlit), plus there are lots of free libraries that make it simple to fetch and analyze weather data.
